# Understanding Distributions

Distributions in statistics describe **how data is spread or distributed** across different values. They help us understand the **frequency** of data points and provide insights into the **shape, center, and variability** of the data.

## Types of Distributions

### 1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
- **Shape**: Bell curve, symmetric around the mean.
- **Examples**: Heights, IQ scores, blood pressure.
- **Key Features**:
  - Mean = Median = Mode
  - 68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation from the mean, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3.

### 2. Uniform Distribution
- **Shape**: Rectangular, where all values have equal probability.
- **Example**: Rolling a fair die (each outcome has an equal chance).
- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: Flat line.

---

### 3. Binomial Distribution
- **For Discrete Data (Success/Failure)**.
- **Examples**: Flipping a coin multiple times, number of defective products in a batch.
- **Key Features**: Based on fixed trials and the probability of success \( p \).

---

### 4. Poisson Distribution
- **Counts of rare events over a fixed time or space**.
- **Examples**: Number of car accidents per month, calls to a customer service center.

---

### 5. Exponential Distribution
- **Time between events in a Poisson process**.
- **Example**: Time until the next earthquake or customer arrival in a queue.
- **Key Feature**: Skewed to the right.

---

### 6. Chi-Square Distribution
- Used in **hypothesis testing and confidence intervals** for variance.
- **Example**: Goodness-of-fit test.

## Continuous vs. Discrete Distributions

| **Continuous Distribution**           | **Discrete Distribution**         |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Data can take **any value** within a range | Data can take **specific values** |
| **Example**: Heights, temperatures      | **Example**: Number of students in a class |

---

## Why Are Distributions Important?
- Help in **visualizing data**.
- Guide in **making statistical inferences**.
- Identify **outliers** and anomalies.
- Determine **probabilities** of certain outcomes.
- Aid in **modeling real-world phenomena**.
