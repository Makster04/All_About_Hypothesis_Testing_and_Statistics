### Graph Examples
- **- Absolute Deviation (Left Graph):** Shows the absolute differences between each data point and the mean. The dashed red line represents the mean absolute deviation (MAD).
- **- Standard Deviation (Right Graph):** Displays the squared differences from the mean. The dashed red line represents the variance, which is the average of these squared deviations.
