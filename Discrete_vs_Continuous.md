## Discrete vs Continuous
- **- Discrete Data** consists of distinct, separate values that can be counted. It typically involves whole numbers and cannot be subdivided meaningfully. Examples include the number of students in a class, number of cars in a parking lot, or shoe sizes.
  
- **- Continuous Data** can take any value within a given range and can be measured with precision. It often involves fractions or decimals. Examples include height, weight, temperature, or time.

- **- Discrete Data (Bar Chart)** – This represents the number of students in different classes. The values are distinct and countable.
- **- Continuous Data (Histogram)** – This shows a distribution of individuals' heights. The values are measured and can take any value within a range.
