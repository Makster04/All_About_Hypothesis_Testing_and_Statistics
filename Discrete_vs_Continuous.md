## Discrete vs Continuous

### Definitions
#### DISCRETE
- **- Discrete Data** consists of distinct, separate values that can be counted. It typically involves whole numbers and cannot be subdivided meaningfully. Examples include the number of students in a class, number of cars in a parking lot, or shoe sizes.
- **- Discrete function** is defined only at specific, separate points (e.g., integers or specific values). It is often represented as a set of distinct points rather than a continuous curve. Example: 𝑓(𝑥)= 𝑥^2 for 𝑥 being only whole number.
#### CONTINUOUS 
- **- Continuous Data** can take any value within a given range and can be measured with precision. It often involves fractions or decimals. Examples include height, weight, temperature, or time.
- **- Continuous Function** is defined for all values in a given interval without breaks or jumps. It can be graphed as a smooth, unbroken curve. Example: 𝑓(𝑥)= 𝑥^2 for all real numbers 𝑥.

#### Explanation of the Graphs
- **- Discrete Data (Bar Chart)** – This represents the number of students in different classes. The values are distinct and countable.
- **- Continuous Data (Histogram)** – This shows a distribution of individuals' heights. The values are measured and can take any value within a range.
