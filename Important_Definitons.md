# Definitions

## 1. Hypothesis Testing & Types of Tests
These terms are related to hypothesis formulation and testing procedures.

### Null Hypothesis (H₀)
**Importance:** The default assumption stating no effect or difference exists.  
**Example:** In a drug study, H₀ might state that the drug has no effect on blood pressure.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
**Importance:** The hypothesis that contradicts the null, indicating an effect or difference exists.  
**Example:** In a drug study, H₁ states that the drug lowers blood pressure.

### Z-Test
**Importance:** Compares population means when sample size is large (n > 30) and variance is known.  
**Example:** Testing if a school’s average IQ differs from the national average.

### T-Test
**Importance:** Compares means of two groups when the sample size is small (n < 30) or variance is unknown.  
**Example:** Comparing two diet plans for significant differences in weight loss.

### One-Sample T-Test
**Importance:** Compares a sample mean to a known value.  
**Example:** Testing if a factory’s output differs from 100 units/day.

### Two-Sample T-Test
**Importance:** Compares means of two independent groups.  
**Example:** Comparing salaries between two companies.

### Paired T-Test
**Importance:** Compares means from the same group at different times (before and after).  
**Example:** Comparing students’ test scores before and after tutoring.

### One-Tailed Test
**Importance:** Tests for a significant difference in one direction only (greater or less).  
**Example:** Testing if students score higher than 75 on an exam.

### Two-Tailed Test
**Importance:** Tests for differences in both directions.  
**Example:** Checking if a product’s average rating differs from 4 stars.

### T-Test IN-Power Object
**Importance:** Refers to a tool or method used to calculate and assess the power of a t-test within a specific statistical software or framework.  
**Example:** The T-Test IN-Power object in statistical software can help determine if your test has enough power to detect an effect.

## 2. Statistical Errors & Significance
Understanding the risks and measures of significance in testing.

### Type 1 Error (False Positive)
**Importance:** Rejecting a true null hypothesis.  
**Example:** Convicting an innocent person in court.

### Type 2 Error (False Negative)
**Importance:** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.  
**Example:** Acquitting a guilty person in court.

### P-Value
**Importance:** Probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed ones, assuming H₀ is true.  
**Example:** A p-value of 0.03 indicates a 3% chance the result is due to random variation.

### Alpha (α)
**Importance:** The significance level, or the probability of Type 1 error (commonly 0.05 or 0.01).  
**Example:** With α = 0.05, there’s a 5% chance of rejecting a true H₀.

### Critical Region
**Importance:** The set of values where H₀ is rejected.  
**Example:** In a 95% confidence test, results beyond ±1.96 fall in the critical region.

### Underlying Distribution Overlap
**Importance:** The degree to which two distributions share common values, affecting the ability to distinguish between groups.  
**Example:** If treatment and control groups have overlapping distributions, it’s harder to detect a significant difference.

### Fluctuation
**Importance:** Describes the variability or random changes in data, often affecting measurements or outcomes.  
**Example:** Daily stock prices fluctuate due to market conditions.

## 3. Distribution & Variability
Understanding how data is distributed and varies.

### Standard Deviation (σ)
**Importance:** Measures the spread of data around the mean.  
**Example:** If test scores have σ = 10, most scores are within ±10 of the mean.

### Standard Error (SE)
**Importance:** Measures the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.  
**Example:** SE = 2 indicates the population mean is likely within ±2 points of the sample mean.

### T-Distribution
**Importance:** Used for small sample sizes; accounts for variability.  
**Example:** Used in a study with only 15 participants.

### Z-Score
**Importance:** A standardized score indicating how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.  
**Example:** A test score with a Z-score of 2 is 2 SDs above average.

## 4. Effect & Practical Significance
Measuring and interpreting the importance of findings.

### Effect Size
**Importance:** Measures the magnitude of differences; indicates practical significance.  
**Example:** A large effect size means the result is meaningful beyond statistical significance.

## 5. Research Design & Study Setup
Proper planning ensures reliable results.

### Experimental Design
**Importance:** Planning a study to ensure valid and reliable results.  
**Example:** A double-blind study to eliminate bias in drug trials.

### Random Sampling
**Importance:** Ensures every individual has an equal chance of being selected, reducing bias.  
**Example:** Randomly selecting participants from a population.

### Random Assignment
**Importance:** Randomly assigning participants to control or experimental groups to reduce confounding variables.  
**Example:** Assigning patients to a treatment group or placebo group randomly.

### Control Group
**Importance:** A baseline group that does not receive treatment, used for comparison.  
**Example:** A placebo group in a drug trial.

### Threshold Power
**Importance:** The minimum power needed to detect a true effect with statistical significance. Helps reduce Type 2 errors.  
**Example:** A threshold power of 80% ensures an adequate chance of detecting a true effect.

## 6. Advanced Concepts
For deeper statistical understanding.

### Confidence Interval (CI)
**Importance:** A range of values likely to contain the population parameter.  
**Example:** A 95% CI for mean weight loss might be 5–10 lbs.

### Power of a Test
**Importance:** The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (avoiding Type 2 error).  
**Example:** A study with 80% power has a good chance of detecting a true effect.

### Degrees of Freedom (df)
**Importance:** Number of independent values in a calculation; affects critical values in t-tests.  
**Example:** In a t-test with 10 samples, df = 9.
