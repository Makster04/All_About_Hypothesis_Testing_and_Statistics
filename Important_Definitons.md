# Important Definitions
### P-Value
**Importance:** Helps determine statistical significance; a low p-value suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **Example:** A p-value of 0.03 in a drug trial suggests only a 3% chance the observed effect is due to random variation, so researchers may conclude the drug is effective.

### Sigma (σ)
**Importance:** Measures variability in a population; helps assess data consistency and predictability.
- **Example:** If a factory's machine produces screws with a diameter of 10mm and σ = 0.1mm, quality control can ensure deviations remain within acceptable limits.

### Z-Score
**Importance:** Standardizes data, allowing comparison across different datasets and determining the likelihood of specific values occurring.
Example: A student's test score of 85 with a mean of 75 and σ = 5 has a Z-score of 2, meaning the score is 2 standard deviations above average.

### Critical Region
**Importance:** Defines thresholds for rejecting a null hypothesis; ensures rigorous decision-making in hypothesis testing.
- **Example:** In a clinical study, if a test statistic falls within the critical region (e.g., beyond ±1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the new treatment is considered significantly different.

### Alpha (α)
**Importance:** Controls the risk of Type I errors (false positives), balancing confidence and sensitivity in statistical testing.
- **Example:** If α = 0.05 in an A/B test for a website change, there’s a 5% risk of falsely concluding the new design improves user engagement when it actually doesn’t.
