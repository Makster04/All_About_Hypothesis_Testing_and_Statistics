# Important Definitions
### Null Hypothesis
**Importance:** A statistical assumption stating no effect or difference exists in a population. It serves as the default claim, tested against alternative hypotheses to determine statistical significance in research.
- **Example**: In a drug effectiveness study, the null hypothesis (H₀) might be "The new drug has no effect on blood pressure compared to a placebo." If statistical analysis shows a low p-value (e.g., < 0.05), researchers may reject H₀ and conclude the drug is effective.

### P-Value
**Importance:** The probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed ones, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **Example:** A p-value of 0.03 in a drug trial suggests only a 3% chance the observed effect is due to random variation, so researchers may conclude the drug is effective.

### Sigma (σ)
**Importance:** A measure of standard deviation in a population, representing data spread around the mean. Larger sigma values indicate greater variability, while smaller values suggest tightly clustered data points.
- **Example:** If a factory's machine produces screws with a diameter of 10mm and σ = 0.1mm, quality control can ensure deviations remain within acceptable limits.

### Z-Score
**Importance:** A standardized score indicating how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Positive values are above the mean; negative values are below the mean.
- **Example:** A student's test score of 85 with a mean of 75 and σ = 5 has a Z-score of 2, meaning the score is 2 standard deviations above average.

### Critical Region
**Importance:** The set of values in a statistical test where, if the test statistic falls within this region, the null hypothesis is rejected. Its size depends on the chosen significance level.
- **Example:** In a clinical study, if a test statistic falls within the critical region (e.g., beyond ±1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the new treatment is considered significantly different.

### Alpha (α)
**Importance:** The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true, also known as the significance level. Common values are 0.05 or 0.01, indicating acceptable error rates.
- **Example:** If α = 0.05 in an A/B test for a website change, there’s a 5% risk of falsely concluding the new design improves user engagement when it actually doesn’t.
