Differentiating PMF, PDF, and CDF in Terms of Cumulative Probabilities

### PMF (Probability Mass Function)
**- Purpose:** Defines the probability of a discrete random variable taking a specific value.
**- Mathematically:** 𝑃(𝑋=𝑥)
**- Example:** 𝑃(𝑋=2)= 0.3 (which means there's a 30% chance that 
𝑋 equals 2.)
- *-* The sum of all PMF values must equal 1.

### PDF (Probability Density Function)
- Purpose: Defines the probability density of a continuous random variable.
- Probability of a range: 𝑃(𝑎≤𝑋≤𝑏)=∫𝑎𝑏𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
P(a≤X≤b)=∫ ab
- The integral over all possible values must equal 1.
### CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
- Purpose: Gives the cumulative probability that 𝑋 is less than or equal to a certain value.
Mathematically: 𝐹(𝑥)=𝑃(𝑋≤𝑥)
Example (Discrete): 𝐹(2)= 𝑃(𝑋≤2)= 𝑃(𝑋=0) + 𝑃(𝑋=1)  +𝑃(𝑋=2)
Always starts at 0 and ends at 1 as 𝑥→∞

#### Examples:
**- PMF (Probability Mass Function)** – Shows probabilities for a discrete variable using a stem plot.
**- PDF (Probability Density Function)** – Represents a continuous probability density (Normal distribution).
**- CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)** – Displays cumulative probabilities for both discrete and continuous distributions.
