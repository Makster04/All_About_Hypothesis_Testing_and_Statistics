| **μ**            | Population Mean                     | The average of an entire population. |
| **x̄**            | Sample Mean                         | The average of a sample taken from the population. |
| **n**            | Sample Size                         | Number of observations in a sample. |
| **σ**            | Population Standard Deviation        | Measure of data dispersion around the mean for a population. |
| **s**            | Sample Standard Deviation            | Measure of data dispersion around the mean for a sample. |
