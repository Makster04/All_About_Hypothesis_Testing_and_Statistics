# Important Definitions

## Intro to Experimental Learning
1. **Make an Observation:** Start by observing something that sparks your curiosity, helping refine a specific question to test, like whether a drug affects headaches or if button color impacts website sales.
2. **Examine the Research:** Review existing research to see if anyone has already answered your question, which might inform your experiment or answer it outright.
3. **Form a Hypothesis:** Develop two hypotheses: the Alternative Hypothesis (your educated guess) and the Null Hypothesis (the opposite). This defines the experimentâ€™s potential outcomes.
4. **Conduct an Experiment:** Test your hypothesis through a well-structured experiment that controls for randomness and external variables, ensuring valid results that reflect the relationship between variables.
5. **Analyze Experimental Results:** Examine the collected data, filter out irrelevant information, and determine if the findings are statistically significant.
6. **Draw Conclusions:** Use the analysis to evaluate if the hypothesis is supported or not. Typically, scientists fail to reject the null hypothesis or reject it, but rarely claim causal relationships outright.

## The Foundation of a Sound Expirement
1. **Control Group/Random Controlled Trials:** A sound experiment includes a control group (no intervention) to compare with the intervention group. Random Controlled Trials (RCTs) ensure unbiased assignment of participants to either group. Double-Blind studies are preferred to eliminate biases from both participants and experimenters.

2. **Appropriate Sampling Techniques and Sample Size:**
- **Independence:** Observations should not influence each other to avoid bias.
- **Random Sampling:** Ensures that each data point has an equal chance of being included, enhancing representativeness.
- **Normal Distribution:** Assumes that repeated sampling will form a bell curve, aiding statistical analysis.
- **Sample Size:** Larger sample sizes reduce randomness and variance, improving the reliability of results.

3. **Reproducibility:** An experiment is reliable if others can reproduce the results by following the same methodology. Reproducibility ensures that findings are not due to chance or hidden variables and confirms the validity of the experiment.
